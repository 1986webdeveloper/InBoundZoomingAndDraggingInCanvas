# InBoundZoomingAndDraggingInCanvas


Demo project to demonstrate using canvas.

In this demo project, we have tried to bound the text in the specific view. User can zoom and drag the view inside the view. If the width of the view increases, it will get break down in another line. In this demo i have used static layout for android version greater than or equal to marshmallow.
